**Brian Hugh Warner** (born January 5, 1969), known professionally as **Marilyn Manson**, is an American rock musician. He came to prominence as the lead singer of [the band that shares his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Manson_(band)), of which he remains the only constant member since its formation in 1989. Known for his controversial stage personality and public image, his stage name (like the other founding members of the band) was formed by combining the names of two opposing American cultural icons: actress [Marilyn Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe) and cult leader [Charles Manson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson).
